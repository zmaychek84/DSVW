It occurs when an application uses user input to construct an SQL query without properly sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or executing commands on the database server.\n\nIn Python, this vulnerability can occur when using the `params[\"id\"]` in a string format to construct an SQL query. If the `params[\"id\"]` is directly included in the query string, an attacker could provide a malicious value that alters the query.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, never construct SQL queries using string formatting with unsanitized user input. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which can ensure that user input is properly escaped and cannot alter the structure of the query.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of constructing the query as a string, use a parameterized query. Here's an example using the `sqlite3` library:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef get_user(params):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    # BAD: String-based query construction\n    # c.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {params['id']}\")\n\n    # GOOD: Parameterized query\n    c.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", (params['id'],))\n\n    return c.fetchone()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `?` in the query is a placeholder that `sqlite3` will replace with the value of `params['id']`, properly escaping it to prevent SQL injection.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\n- sqlite3 (built-in with Python)\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)"

This can allow an attacker to open a URL with a scheme that is not intended to be permitted, potentially leading to various attacks such as remote file inclusion (RFI), local file inclusion (LFI), or even command execution.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to always validate the scheme of a URL before opening it. This can be done by using a whitelist of permitted schemes and checking that the scheme of the URL is in this list before opening it. Additionally, it is also recommended to use secure coding practices and to keep your Python environment and libraries up to date.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can validate the scheme of a URL before opening it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.parse\n\ndef open_url(url):\n    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)\n    if parsed_url.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:\n        raise ValueError(f'Invalid scheme: {parsed_url.scheme}')\n    # open the URL here\n```\n\nIn this example, the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module is used to parse the URL and extract its scheme. Then, it checks if the scheme is in the list of permitted schemes (`http` and `https`), and if not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any additional library dependencies beyond the Python standard library.\n\n## OWASP and CWE Resources\n\n- [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are valid and active at the time of writing this report."

The `exec()` function is a built-in Python function that executes the Python program, which is either a string or object code. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed unless a syntax error occurs and if it is an object code, it is simply executed. \n\nThe vulnerability arises when an attacker can control the input to the `exec()` function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, which is a serious security risk. \n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nAvoid using `exec()` function whenever possible. If it is necessary to use it, make sure that the input to the function is not controlled by the user or sanitized properly before use. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of using `exec()`, consider using safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval()`. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\n# Instead of this:\n# exec(program, envs)\n\n# Do this:\nast.literal_eval(program)\n```\n\nIn this example, `ast.literal_eval()` safely parses and evaluates an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. It raises an exception if the input isn't a valid Python datatype, so the code won't be executed if it's unsafe.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `ast` library, which is a built-in Python library and doesn't need to be installed separately.\n\n## OWASP and CWE Resources\n\n- [OWASP Python Security - Dangerous Functions](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/security.html#dangerous-functions)\n- [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)\n\nPlease note that these links are valid and active at the time of writing this report."

If an attacker can control the data being written to `sys.stdout`, it can lead to information disclosure or other potential security issues.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to always validate and sanitize user inputs. Never trust user inputs blindly. Specifically for URLs, always validate the scheme and ensure it is in the list of permitted schemes.
